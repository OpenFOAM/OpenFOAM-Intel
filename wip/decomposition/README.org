Two decomposition methods looked at when running on a Xeon and original Xeon Phi accelerator, Knights Corner or KNC.  The KNC needed to go through the host in order to communicate and so a bounding decomposition was tested where the host completely surrounded the KNC partitions - but the decomposition resulted in a lot of communication.  The heterogeneous decomposition used to partition the domain so that Xeon cores would receive larger partitions and the KNC cores would be smaller (but more of them).

This is not used now but just for reference.
